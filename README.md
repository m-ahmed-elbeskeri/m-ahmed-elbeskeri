I build tools to make my job easier — and other people's. Sometimes it's [workflow orchestration frameworks](https://github.com/Puffinflow-io/puffinflow), sometimes it's tooling for Unreal Engine, sometimes it's whatever rabbit hole I fell into at 2am.

Chemical engineer with a PhD by day, but most of my time goes into writing code for things that should exist but don't yet.

## Currently

- **[PuffinFlow](https://github.com/Puffinflow-io/puffinflow)** — LLM workflow orchestration framework. Faster than LangGraph and LlamaIndex in benchmarks. MIT licensed.

## Stack

Python · C++ · C# · JS/TS · Rust · Zig (playing around with it now)
